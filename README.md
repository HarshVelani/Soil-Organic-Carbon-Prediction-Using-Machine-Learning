### Predicting Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) Levels in the Dhanaulti Region Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and data for predicting Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) levels in the Dhanaulti region using a Machine Learning (ML) approach. The Dhanaulti region is known for its diverse ecosystems, but factors like land use changes and human interference have led to a decline in SOC levels. By mapping SOC, this study aims to identify vulnerable areas, prioritize conservation efforts, and address soil degradation issues.

#### Objectives
1. Predict SOC Levels: Use ML techniques to accurately predict SOC levels in the Dhanaulti region.
2. Identify Vulnerable Areas: Map SOC levels to identify areas at risk of degradation.
3. Conservation Efforts: Provide data-driven insights to support soil conservation and sustainable land use practices.

#### Key Insights
1. Soil Health and Vulnerability: Mapping SOC levels can provide insights into soil health and its vulnerability to degradation in the Dhanaulti region.
2. Effective Predictions with ML: ML techniques like Quantile Regression Forest can effectively predict SOC levels and associated uncertainties.
3. Conservation and Sustainability: Understanding SOC dynamics through ML can aid in conservation efforts and promote sustainable land use practices.
4. Decision-Making: SOC mapping is crucial for informed decision-making and resource management.
5. Overcoming Challenges: The use of ML in predicting SOC levels shows promise in overcoming challenges and improving our understanding of soil dynamics.

#### Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)
SOC is the carbon stored in the soil resulting from the decomposition of plant and animal matter. It is crucial for maintaining soil health and fertility.

#### The benefits of SOC mapping
Mapping SOC levels provides insights into soil health, vulnerability to degradation, and helps in prioritizing conservation efforts. It is essential for informed decision-making and sustainable resource management.

#### The Machine Learning (ML) approach used in the study
The study uses a Quantile Regression Forest model to predict SOC levels. This ML approach analyzes various factors influencing SOC levels, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) data.

#### Importance of mapping SOC levels in the Himalayan region
Mapping SOC levels in the Himalayan region helps identify areas vulnerable to soil degradation and erosion. It supports prioritizing conservation efforts and addressing soil health issues, which are critical for maintaining the ecological balance in the region.

#### Methodology
Data Collection: Collect data from various sources, including satellite imagery and soil samples, focusing on NDVI, DEM, LULC,  data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for ML model training.
Model Training: Train the Quantile Regression Forest model using the preprocessed data to predict SOC levels.
Validation: Validate the model's performance using a separate test dataset and adjust parameters to improve accuracy.
Mapping: Use the trained model to create SOC maps, highlighting areas with different SOC levels and identifying vulnerable regions.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using Machine Learning techniques to predict and map Soil Organic Carbon levels in the Dhanaulti region. By understanding SOC dynamics, we can better prioritize conservation efforts, promote sustainable land use practices, and make informed decisions to combat soil degradation. The approach outlined in this repository serves as a promising tool for improving soil health management and conservation strategies.
